## mdn JS doc

- A JavaScript identifier usually starts with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be digits (0 â€“ 9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters A through Z (uppercase) as well as a through z (lowercase).

- Some examples of legal names are `Number_hits`, `temp99`, `$credit`, and `_name`.

- `var` can be global or local scope. `const` and `let` are block-scope local variables.

- In `var` and `let` declarations, the initializer is optional. If a variable is declared without an initializer, it is assigned the value `undefined`.
